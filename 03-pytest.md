// generate a prompt for basic requirements for data validation using pytest
1. Input Validation:
   - Ensure all inputs are validated for type, format, and length.
   - Use regex for complex validations (e.g., email, phone numbers).

2. Boundary Testing:
   - Test with minimum and maximum input values.
   - Include empty and null inputs.

3. Error Handling:
   - Validate that appropriate error messages are returned for invalid inputs.
   - Test for exception handling in the code.

4. Data Type Checks:
   - Ensure inputs are of the expected data type (e.g., int, float, str).
   - Test with incorrect data types to validate error handling.

5. Integration Testing:
   - Validate data flow between components (e.g., frontend to backend).
   - Test with real-world scenarios and data sets.

6. Performance Testing:
   - Ensure validation logic performs well under load.
   - Test with large data sets to identify potential bottlenecks.

7. Security Testing:
   - Validate against common security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
   - Ensure sensitive data is properly protected and not exposed.
